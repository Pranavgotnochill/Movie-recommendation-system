🎬 Movie Recommendation System 2

📚 Overview

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System 2! This project aims to build a sophisticated recommendation engine that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and previous interactions. The system leverages popular data science techniques, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods, to provide personalized movie recommendations.

🚀 Project Features

Data Exploration & Preprocessing:
Load and preprocess movie datasets to prepare them for the recommendation engine.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns in the data.
Visualize key insights, including movie popularity, user interaction, and more.
Recommendation Techniques:
Content-Based Filtering: Recommend movies similar to those a user has liked in the past based on movie features such as genre, director, and actors.
Collaborative Filtering: Suggest movies by identifying similar users' preferences using matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
Hybrid Approach: Combine both content-based and collaborative filtering methods to enhance recommendation accuracy.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the recommendation system using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Precision@K.
Fine-tune model parameters for optimal performance.
User Interaction:
Implement a simple user interface within the notebook for users to input their preferences and receive movie recommendations.
Provide explanations for why certain movies are recommended, improving user trust and system transparency.
